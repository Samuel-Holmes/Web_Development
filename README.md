# Web_Development

## Project Context 

Creation of an IT helpdesk ticketing system for a fictional case study. Designed to allow both admin and user (school staff) access. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Along with SQL in MySQL database creation and querying. 

## Project Features 

* General users are able to login with their assigned credentials and access a HTML form to submit and IT related ticket
* Admin users are able to login and manage tickets marking them as completed when done
* Data persistence allows for storage capabilities between sessions to allow true functionality

## Project Reflections and Future Improvements

This project was a useful introduction into web development. However, now that my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and system design has improved there is scope to improve the front end of this application. Possibly implementing further functionality and enhancing the general user experience.
